# ITS-site-documentation

This repository houses the documentation for the ITS front-end and back-end.

## Scope

The included documentation covers the tools, resources, standards, and other logistical facets of the ITS website. It does not contain any documentation on modules, or specific code snippets. 

## View Documentation

You can view the documentation here: 

<a href="//github.com/Humber-ITS/ITS-site-documentation/blob/main/ITS-Website-Documentation.pdf">PDF</a>

If you are actively developing the site, it is recommended to clone the respository instead of downloading the PDF manually. This will allow you to pull from the repository to check if there is any updates: 

```
git status
git pull origin main
```
