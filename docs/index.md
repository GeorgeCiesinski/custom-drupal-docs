# Welcome

These docs are for Drupal 10 websites.

## Using these Docs

Documentation is organized into separate pages which attempt to group similar information together in an intuitive way. It is also recommended to use the search feature as some processes require information from multiple pages. 

### Pages

[Drupal Sites](./drupal-sites.md) - Information shared by all Drupal sites. This contains common practices, maintenance, and shared modules.

[Theming](./theming.md) - Information about theming the Drupal Sites.

[Database](./database.md) - Information about the database, including setup, usage, errors, and common functions.

[Development Environments](./development-environments.md) - Information about the local, staging, and production servers.

[Backup and Restore](./backup-restore.md) - Information about backing up site safely.

[Developer Tools](./developer-tools.md) - Information about CLI commands, servers, databases, and other tools used to develop the Drupal sites.
